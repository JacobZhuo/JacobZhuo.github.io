I just received my PhD (2023) in Control Science and Engineering from Zhejiang University on the topic of reliable and trustworthy machine learning with particular focus on data-driven manufacturing and industrial applications.

My research interests are broadly across machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), including thier explainability, robustness, and reliability, ensuring beneficial outcomes for people and society. Topics of interest include:

- **Explainable AI:** Computing features' countributions to output prediction for explaining deep models, an efficient approach for locating root cause in anomaly diagnosis.
- **Adversarial Robusness:** Exploring ML model resilience against perturbations, including adversarial attack and countermeasures, formal verification, and robust training.
- **Optimization:** Designing optimization algorithms, encompassing Bayesian optimization, math programming, and multi-objective optimization, in the realm of hyper-parameter optimization and formal verification.
- **Any-shot Learning:** Addressing the model accuracy degradation caused by data scarcity with data augmentation and semi-supervised approaches, for zero-shot, few-shot and imbalanced classification.
- **Anomaly/Fault Diagnosis:** Diagnosing anomaly and fault datasets including the tasks of classification, detection and localization, for industrial process optimization and control.
